# VietnameseAddressStandardization

* An python client on Vietnamese Address Standardization problem based on deep learning.

### Requirements

* It requires ```python```, ```pip```.
* Install requirements packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Inference <br>
* Run code in command line:
```python
import Siameser
std = Siameser.Siameser(stadard_scope='all')
add = '150 kim hoa hà nội'
std_add = std.standardize(add)
print(std_add)
```

* Run code in command line to get top-k standard address:
```python
k = 10
std_adds = std.get_top_k(add, k)
print(std_adds)
```

* API inference
